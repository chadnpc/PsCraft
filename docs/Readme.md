  Sometimes I just want something to work and not to have think about it.

<!-- focus on writing code and not get bogged down in intricacies of
the build process. -->
<p>

<p>
This module aims to eliminate the need to <b>write and test build scripts</b>.
The only code you are expected to write is in <a href="/Public/">Public</a> functions and <a href="Tests">Tests</a>.

ðŸ˜” Tests have to be written by humans. There's just no other way.

**The goal is to give you a starting point that just works.**

All you need to do is run 3 commands minimum, then let an LLM take care of the rest.
